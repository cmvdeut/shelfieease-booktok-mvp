# Cloudflare Pages redirects
# Note: These redirects are handled by Cloudflare Pages, not Next.js middleware
# For static export, we use _redirects file instead of middleware.ts
# Format: /from /to [status code]

# SPA fallback - all routes should serve index.html for client-side routing
# This must be last to catch all routes
